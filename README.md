## Quick Start (Development)

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (any recent version)
- Git

### **Local Development**
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shsingh844/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add your resume files**
   ```bash
   # Create resume directory
   mkdir resume
   
   # Add your resume files
   cp your-us-resume.pdf resume/Resume_SSingh_US.pdf
   cp your-uk-resume.pdf resume/Resume_SSingh_UK.pdf
   ```

4. **Build for development**
   ```bash
   # Without analytics (development mode)
   npm run build
   
   # With analytics (testing smart detection)
   GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-ga-id npm run build
   ```

5. **Serve locally** (Required for file downloads and smart detection)
   ```bash
   # Python server
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js server
   npx serve .
   
   # Visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Production Deployment

### **Render (Recommended)**
1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Connect to Render**
   - Create new Static Site
   - Connect your GitHub repository
3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `.`
4. **Add Environment Variable**
   - **Key**: `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
   - **Value**: Your Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
5. **Deploy** - Smart detection works automatically in production!

### **Other Platforms**
- **Netlify**: Same build command, add environment variable in dashboard
- **Vercel**: Configure build settings and environment variables
- **GitHub Pages**: Requires workflow modification for build step

## Smart Resume Detection

### **Detection Methods**
The system uses multiple sophisticated detection techniques:

1. **Timezone Analysis** (Primary, 80% confidence)
   - Detects `Europe/London`, `Europe/Dublin` for UK
   - Identifies `America/*`, `US/*` timezones for US
   - Most reliable indicator of user location

2. **Language Preferences** (60% confidence)
   - Analyzes `navigator.language` and `navigator.languages`
   - Detects `en-GB` vs `en-US` preferences
   - Browser-level language settings

3. **URL Context** (90% confidence for explicit parameters)
   - URL parameters: `?region=uk` or `?uk=true`
   - Referrer domain analysis (`.uk` domains)
   - Marketing campaign tracking

4. **System Hints** (30% confidence, supplementary)
   - Date format preferences (DD/MM vs MM/DD)
   - Number formatting conventions
   - Locale-specific browser settings

### **Confidence Scoring**
- **High Confidence (60%+)**: Clear geographic indicators
- **Medium Confidence (30-60%)**: Multiple weak signals
- **Low Confidence (<30%)**: Fallback to US format
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user choice

### **Analytics Tracking**
Every detection event is tracked:
- Recommended format and confidence level
- Detection methods used
- User's final choice (if different from recommendation)
- Geographic accuracy over time

## Security Features

This portfolio implements **production-grade security**:

- **No secrets in code** - Analytics ID stored as environment variable
- **Generated builds** - Source template separate from deployed file
- **Secure git** - `.gitignore` prevents committing sensitive files
- **Environment-based config** - Different settings for dev/prod
- **Privacy-conscious detection** - No external geolocation APIs

### **How it works:**
1. **`index-template.html`** contains placeholder `{{GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}}`
2. **Build script** replaces placeholder with environment variable
3. **Generated `index.html`** has real analytics ID and smart detection
4. **Git tracks template only** - no secrets in repository

## Customization

### **For Your Own Portfolio:**
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Update personal information** in `index-template.html`
3. **Replace project details** and links
4. **Modify color scheme** in CSS variables
5. **Create dual resume versions**:
   - US version: American English, US formatting
   - UK version: British English, visa requirements
6. **Configure analytics** with your GA4 Measurement ID
7. **Test smart detection** with different browsers/locations
8. **Deploy** with environment variable configuration

### **Smart Detection Customization:**
```javascript
// Modify detection confidence levels
analyzeTimezone() {
    // Adjust confidence scores for your needs
    confidence: 0.8  // UK timezone detection
}

// Add custom detection methods
analyzeCustomHints() {
    // Your specific user indicators
}
```
